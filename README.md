## Concept
The goal of this game is to protect its base, the house in the center,
against the invasion of enemies, represented by red rectangles. The user can move his
character using the arrow keys or ZQSD. To win, he will have to succeed in touching all
the enemies, which has the effect of freezing them. When an enemy is frozen, it turns black and stops. The
difficulty for the player is that the other unfrozen rectangles may then stop for two seconds.
to resuscitate one of the frozen enemies. The reanimating rectangle then turns yellow. The final objective of the
player is to minimize the score indicated on his house, this one increases indeed when enemies
pass over it. So you can see it as the enemies score, that you must try to maintain the
as low as possible.
